# alpine-node-openssl-fips
This is a Docker Alpine Image with Alpine 3.22, Node 22, and OpenSSL 3.5.0 which is not yet FIPS certified but eventually will be.

The intent of this image is to provide a base Alpine / Node image with a FIPS Certified encryption module for 
FISMA moderate systems requiring a certified encryption module.
